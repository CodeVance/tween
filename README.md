# tween
A fast tween library for arcadia/Unity

This is still experimental, feedback on overall design is welcome.

## implementation

* Tweening is implemented as a component for each tweenable property, this avoids garbage collection allowing high fps.  A tween channel will reuse an existing component, for best performance attach tweens to an object before cloning in game.
* A proxy ```<Tween>``` type stores the specific values of a tween configuration, and can be used as a fn on gameobjects to initiate a tween.
* each property channel has a constructor to create a proxy ```<Tween>```. ```scale``` is the constructor fn for the ```scale_tween``` component.

# usage
```clj
(ns test.core
  (:require [tween.core :as tween]))

;defining a <Tween> via a constructor fn
(def my-move (tween/position (Vector3. -4 0 0) 2.5 :+))

;applying a <Tween> on an object
(my-move (GameObject.))
```



## constructor args
A constructor takes a target value, and options which can be:
* A map of explicit options to merge
* duration (a float)
* :+ (signifies a relative tween)
* :pow2 :pow3 :pow4 :pow5 (will use easing for both :in and :out)
* a callback (function)

# Tweens are associative
```clj
(def z (tween/euler (Vector3. 45 0 100) 0.5))
(def y (assoc z :duration 1.2))
(= z y) ;false

(:duration z)
;0.5
```

Tweens can have the following opts:
```clj
:target
:duration
:in
:out
:callback
:+
```

# callbacks/chained tweens
callbacks are called after the tween has finished. They take 1 arg - the gameobject the tween was attached to:
```clj
(def cb 
  (tween/position 
    (Vector3. 0 0 0) 0.5 
    (fn [go] (UnityEngine.Debug/Log (str "tween ended for " go)))))
```

```<Tweens>``` are suitable callbacks
```clj
(def b (tween/position (Vector3. 0 0 0) 0.5))
(def a (tween/position (Vector3. 0 -2 0) 0.5 b))
```

callbacks are atomic, to facilitate cyclical ```<Tween>``` chains. Associating :callback will actually swap an atom:
```clj
(assoc b :callback a)
;will now repeat
```

```<Tweens>``` can be combined with comp
```clj
(def comp-tween (tween-a tween-b))
(comp-tween (GameObject.))
```

## provided tweens
```
position scale euler material-color text-color light-color light-range material-texture-offset
```

# custom tweens
You can define new tween properties with the ```deftween``` macro.

```-get``` and ```-value``` are the basic required methods
```clj
(tween/deftween camera-size [^float value ^float target]
  (-get [this] (.fieldOfView (.GetComponent this "Camera")))
  (-value [this] (float (+ value (* (- target value) (.ratio this))))))

((camera-size 45 5.0 ) (UnityEngine.Camera/main))
```

The ```value``` and ```target``` prop args must be defined.

The macro will also define hinted props for 
```^boolean active ^float delay ^float start ^float duration ^boolean relative ^float ratio ^int uid```
as well as non-serialziable props for ```getfn addfn easefn``` which hold clojure fn's



To allow relative tweens, you must provide an ```-add``` method (it will default to Vector3/op_Addition)

```clj
(deftween text-color [^Color value ^Color target]
  (-add [a b] (Color/op_Addition a b))
  (-get [this] (.color (.GetComponent this "TextMesh")))
  (-value [this] (Color/Lerp (.value this) (.target this) (.ratio this))))
 ```

Setting the tween value defaults to the form ```(set! ~-get ~-value)```. 

If a different form is needed, you can also define a ```-set``` method (note the -value method is now unused)
```clj
 (deftween material-texture-offset [^Vector2 value ^Vector2 target] 
  (-get [this] (.GetTextureOffset (.material (.GetComponent this UnityEngine.Renderer) "_MainTex")))
  (-add [a b] (Vector2/op_Addition a b))
  (-set [this] (.SetTextureOffset (.material (.GetComponent this UnityEngine.Renderer)) 
                                  "_MainTex" 
                                  (Vector2/Lerp (.value this) (.target this) (.ratio this)))))
 ```
